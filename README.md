# markdown_new_page

Chrome extension which replaces new tab page with a notepad. 

### Releases
* F. Lane (1.0)
  * Support for editing, saving, deleting, loading, and downloading for __one__ file only
    * Partially to prevent filling up the chrome sync and partially because I felt multiple files was too much feature creep for version 1.0. It really only needs to be able to take notes. 
    * Downloads as a .md file only. (file name is ```note.md```)
  * Implemented a UI that tries its hardest to get out of the way. Its a notepad.
